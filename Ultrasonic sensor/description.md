This is an Ultrasonic Distance Measurement System using the HC-SR04 sensor and Arduino Uno.

The HC-SR04 sensor is used to measure the distance between itself and an object using ultrasonic waves.

The Trig pin sends out an ultrasonic pulse.

The Echo pin receives the reflected pulse.

The Arduino calculates the time taken for the echo to return and uses it to compute the distance.

The measured distance is then printed on the Serial Monitor.

##Connections:

VCC → 5V (Power supply)

GND → GND

Trig → Digital Pin 11 (Output)

Echo → Digital Pin 10 (Input)

##Working Principle:
The sensor sends an ultrasonic sound wave when the trigger pin is activated. It waits for the wave to bounce back and calculates the time taken for the round trip. Using the speed of sound, it then computes the distance to the object.
